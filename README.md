#Bronze Medalist Lab

Function takes in an array and..
  - returns the third largest (bronze medalist) of them all
  - returns `false` for an empty array
  - returns `Unknown` for an array of mixed datatypes

Example:
An array of strings, for instance `["hello", "world", "before", "all"]` would return `world` because although "before" is 6 letters long, and "hello" and "world" are both 5, world appeared as the last 5 letter word in the array.

If the array was `["hello", "world", "after", "all"]` the returned value would be `after` because the first three words are all 5 letters long, so the last one is returned.

An an array of numbers would return the third largest number.

An array of mixed datatypes (e.g. `["hello", 3, null, "world", true]`) would return `Unknown`.


## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\bronze-medalist.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
